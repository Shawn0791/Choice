## Game Overview
I led the production of the first half of the project. Due to certain reasons, the project experienced a change in programmers and designers for the second half, resulting in a very fragmented game style. so I suggest you just play the first stage. :P

The game as a whole is divided into three parts and follows the social issues that the protagonist faces in all three periods from childhood to adulthood and finally to old age. The game as a whole takes a critical thinking approach and focuses on the player's torment as they are faced with a puzzle.

The game uses an interpolated narrative, starting with the protagonist's memories when he is on the verge of death until he finally faces it again.

Life is like a train moving forward in a fog, and the choice at each fork in the road is irreversible. But these seemingly optional junctions actually have a set focus on the track, and people sometimes appear to have choices, but the choices don't change anything.
